        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          Our company was created with one clear idea in mind: to redefine what a chauffeur service should be on the Côte d’Azur. 
          We combine years of experience in luxury transportation, hospitality and concierge services to deliver a truly tailored experience 
          for every client.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you are travelling for business, attending a film festival in Cannes, visiting a yacht show in Monaco or simply enjoying 
          a weekend in Nice, we make sure every journey feels effortless, comfortable and perfectly organised.

        <h2>Our philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          We believe that a chauffeur service is much more than just a car with a driver. It is about trust, discretion, timing and 
          attention to detail. From the moment you contact us, every step is handled with care: route planning, vehicle selection, 
          flight monitoring and personalised preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our chauffeurs are trained to anticipate your needs, adapt to your schedule and provide a calm, safe and refined environment 
          throughout your journey.
